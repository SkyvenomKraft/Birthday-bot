Developed in Python 3.9.6

Simple bot to send messages over the course of a designated time period to a user.
This was originally made as a birthday present for a friend, so it's somewhat specific in it's use. 
Planning to refactor when I am finished with WIP calendar app

NOTE: Requires web hosting to function properly. Putting the bot to sleep without web hosting will disconnect the bot and auto restart the progression of sent files upon awakening.
